# Jumping-Dog
**Overview:**

With one of the p5.play games, "Flappy Bird," I want to create a dog game similar to the offline Google dinosaur game. I will replace the bird with a dog and have it walk on land rather than fly. I will replace the pipes from the Flappy Bird game with objects that players will have to jump over rather than through. Finally, I will attempt to give the dog some movement/animation and change the colors of the original theme while adding some clouds.
