    <p class="description">
      Climate change is a social and economic issue that I have acknowledged for<br>
      years. Living sustainably and trying to spread the word has always been a<br>
      practice for me, but many people do not do the same. Through my game, I<br>
      want to give a perspective on the end effects of climate change: sea<br>
      levels rising to the point that they're deadly. Today on Earth, we face<br>
      a future that is just as threatening due to the emissions of greenhouse<br>
      gases solely due to human activity.
